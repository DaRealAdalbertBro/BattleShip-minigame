# BattleShip Minigame
Battleship (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle) is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player.

STILL IN PROGRESS

## TO DO:
- FIX: *terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error' what(): basic_string::_M_construct null not valid*
- ADD: *Logic of shooting for the enemy (currently only random)*
